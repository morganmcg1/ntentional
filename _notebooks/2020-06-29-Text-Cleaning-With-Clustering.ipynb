    "In order for Machine Translation to be useful in the real world, we should should strive to train it on high quality translation data. This is doubly true for lower-resource languages such as Irish, where clean training data is relatively limited. In this article we will try and identify and remove clusters of dirty/noisey samples in our parallalel dataset. The stages we will go through are:\n",

    "## Dimension Reduction - UMAP\n",
    "- Dimensionality reduction techniques attempt to find the latent features in your data\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a dimension reduction technique published in [2018 by McInnes and Healy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426) that can be used for visualisation of high dimensional data, similarly to [[t-SNE]]. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Its main advantage is that it is fast (faster than t-SNE when dealing with large datasets) and also better maintains the global structure of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- [Pair Code has an excellent explanation complete with visualisations of UMAP](https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/#:~:text=In%20the%20simplest%20sense%2C%20UMAP,behind%20them%20is%20remarkably%20simple) if you'd like to learn more and docs also have excellent [interactive visualisation examples from users](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactive_viz.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- It also has [beautifully well-written](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) documentation \n",
    "\n",
    "- McInnes gives a useful overview of UMAP here at the SciPy 2018 conference:\n",

    "## Similarity Search - nmslib\n",
    "- [nmslib](https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib/blob/master/python_bindings/notebooks/search_sparse_cosine.ipynb) is an \"__efficient similarity search library and a toolkit for evaluation of k-NN methods for generic non-metric spaces__\" and is easily installed with ```pip install nmslib```\n",
    "    \n",
    "- In testing [Ben Frederickson found](http://www.benfrederickson.com/approximate-nearest-neighbours-for-recommender-systems/) that between nmslib, [FAISS](https://engineering.fb.com/ml-applications/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/) (Facebook) and [annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) (Spotify) nmslib was the fastest nearest neighbours library for CPU. Note FAISS on GPU is blazes past nmslib and annoy, but can also difficult to set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus) is an interesting library that was open sourced in late 2019 which offers similarity search using FAISS, nmslib or annoy as well as GPU capability. If I had had more time I would have explored this further\n",
    "\n",
    "-  ElasticSearch [post](https://www.elastic.co/blog/text-similarity-search-with-vectors-in-elasticsearch) and [article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/elasticbert-information-retrieval-using-bert-and-elasticsearch-51fef465b9ae) is yet another tool we could use to carry out the similarity search between our text embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally,  [DAIR.ai](www.dair.ai) recently posted a video called [\"101 Ways to Solve Search\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHm6_uC4vxM) by [Pratik Bhavsar](www.pratik.ai) which is a great introduction to how search works in general. Also [models.pratik.ai](models.pratik.ai) is a really great flow chart visualisation which he tries to keep up to date of the models and techniques available for semantic search and NLP in general\n",
    "\n",
    "> youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHm6_uC4vxM\n",
    "\n",
    "- BONUS: [@hmendonca's EDA notebook on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hmendonca/proper-clustering-with-facenet-embeddings-eda) is an excellent example showing how to use annoy to group and display similar images (faces in this case).\n",

    "## Text Embeddings - XLM-R\n",
    "\n",
    "We derive our text embedding by passing the text sample though [XLM-RoBERTa Large](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02116) and extracting the values in final hidden layer. XLM-R  is a multilingual model and should work reasonably well for both Irish and English\n",
    "\n",
    "Research has been done on BERT to show that by concatenating the final 4 layers of the model one gets even richer contextual embeddings. In the interest of simplicity we will stick to the final layer only for the moment, although using additional layers would be an interesting area of exploration!"

The [fastai forums post](https://forums.fast.ai/t/nlp-any-libraries-dictionaries-out-there-for-fixing-common-spelling-errors/16411) is also worth a read if you have time, they also created a \"pretentiousness\" embedding to score news outlets 🤣.\n",

We will also lowercae our entire dataset; many of the legal texts here are fully written in uppercase, however right now we care more about the content of the text as opposed to the style"
